## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of cars and pedestrians in both 2D images and videos using popular computer vision deep learning algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector).

## Installation

To run the project locally, execute the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo_yolo.py # for image
python demo_video.py # for video 
```

## Methodology

### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects within an image in a single forward pass of the neural network. It achieves high accuracy and speed by dividing the input image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly.

### SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)

SSD is another popular object detection algorithm that predicts object bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. It uses a series of convolutional layers to predict a fixed set of bounding boxes with different aspect ratios and scales.
